**Chart Referenced:**  
**Employees Not Due for Promotion (KPI Card)**

**Observation:**  
There are **870 employees** currently **not due for promotion** based on the promotion eligibility criteria.

**Interpretation:**  
A significant portion of the workforce has either been **recently promoted** or **does not yet meet** the threshold for promotion. This may indicate a **stable workforce** or potentially a **development lag** for newer or early-career employees.

**Recommendation:**  
Monitor this group's progression to ensure timely readiness for future promotions. Implement **career development plans** (e.g., training, mentorship, rotation programs) to prepare them for advancement. Ensure **clear communication** of promotion pathways and use supporting metrics (e.g., attrition risk) to anticipate engagement issues.

**Employees Due for Promotion (KPI Card)**
**Chart Referenced:**  
**Employees Due for Promotion (KPI Card)**

**Observation:**  
There are **40 employees** who are **currently due for promotion** based on tenure and time since last promotion.

**Interpretation:**  
This group represents employees likely ready for **career advancement**, and delaying promotion may result in **reduced motivation or increased attrition risk**. It may also signal areas where internal mobility or leadership pipeline planning is needed.

**Recommendation:**  
Prioritize **performance evaluations** and consider this group for promotion or role enhancement. Incorporate them into **succession planning** and leadership development tracks. Ensure that promotion decisions are **equitable, data-driven**, and aligned with business needs.

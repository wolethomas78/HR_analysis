## Key Insights & Recommendations
### KPI Insight Summary
**Chart Referenced:**  
**Employees Not Due for Promotion (KPI Card)**

**Observation:**  
There are **870 employees** currently **not due for promotion** based on the promotion eligibility criteria.

**Interpretation:**  
A significant portion of the workforce has either been **recently promoted** or **does not yet meet** the threshold for promotion. This may indicate a **stable workforce** or potentially a **development lag** for newer or early-career employees.

**Recommendation:**  
Monitor this group's progression to ensure timely readiness for future promotions. Implement **career development plans** (e.g., training, mentorship, rotation programs) to prepare them for advancement. Ensure **clear communication** of promotion pathways and use supporting metrics (e.g., attrition risk) to anticipate engagement issues.
